# Step 3: Commit to organising code by layers
Now that we've got a domain model that makes a little more sense, let's start organising our code so that we can enforce the direction of dependencies.

1. Add a class library project called `Infrastructure`.
2. Add the EF Core dependencies from `Presentation` to this project (Design and SQLServer).
3. Make the `Infrastructure` project depend on the `Domain` project.
4. Move the `Data` and `Migrations` folders from `Presentation` to `Infrastructure`.
5. Update the namespaces in the classes in the `Data` and `Migration` folders:
    - `SpaghettiCommerce.Data` => `SpaghettiCommerce.Infrastructure.Data`
    - `SpaghettiCommerce.Migrations` => `SpaghettiCommerce.Infrastructure.Migrations`
7. In the `Presentation` project, update all the references to these classes to use the new namespace.

Build and run the solution now to make sure it still works before moving on to the next step.
