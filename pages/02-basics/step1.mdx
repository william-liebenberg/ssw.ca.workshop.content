# Step 1: Separate the solution into layers

It's difficult to maintain code, and more importantly enforce the direction of dependencies, when all your code is in one project. We'll separate SpaghettiCommerce into four layers:
* Presentation
* Infrastructure
* Application
* Domain

`Domain` is at the center, surrounded by `Application`. `Domain` and `Application` together represent Core. `Infrastructure` and `Presentation` both occupy the next layer, and all dependencies point inward. This means `Domain` has no external dependencies, `Application` depends on `Domain`, and `Infrastructure` and `Presentation` both depend on `Application`.

In any refactor like this, you should always start with the Domain, and that's what we'll do here:
1. Rename the `SpaghettiCommerce` project to `Presentation`.
2. Add a class library project called `Domain`.
3. In the `Domain` project add a folder called `Models`.
4. Move all the models from the `Models` folder in `Presentation` to the `Models` folder in `Domain`.

    > **Warning**
    > Don't move the Product class from the Products folder just yet (we do this in Step 2)

5. Update the namespaces in all of the classes in the `Models` folder (`SpaghettiCommerce.Models` => `SpaghettiCommerce.Domain.Models`).
6. Make the `Presentation` project depend on `Domain`.
7. In the `Presentation` project, update all the references to the models to use the new namespace.

Before we move on, build and run the project to make sure it still works.
